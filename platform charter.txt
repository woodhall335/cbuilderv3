Contract Heaven — Platform Charter (UK v1)
Purpose

Deliver a helpful, UK-specific document platform that turns free guidance into high-trust paid outcomes. Public copy avoids “AI”; outputs include a Certificate of Curation and Applicable Laws Summary.

Products:

Ask Heaven (free Q&A; 200-word answers with 1–3 statute refs).

Letters: Basic (free) and Custom (paid £5–£7) with free Day-7 follow-up; optional E-sign £3.

Small Claims Court Pack: £19 (escalation) / £29 (standalone).

Contracts: £10 via Contract Wizard; optional E-sign £3.

Rewrite: £40 from analyser.

OCR Translation: £20.

Brand & Compliance

Public phrasing: “Curated by Contract Heaven. Completed by You.”

Clear scope: we prepare paperwork; users file/serve; not legal advice.

Jurisdiction depth via thin law-packs (acts/sections) and automated assertions before unlock.

Information Architecture (ISR everywhere)

/ (Home) → Ask Heaven widget (question + region + name + email).

/ask → /ask/result (answer + smart CTAs).

/letters → /letters/[region]/[slug] (basic preview; upsell to Custom; Day-7 follow-up).

/contracts → /contracts/[region]/[slug] (SEO page → wizard).

/contract-wizard (select contract + region → dynamic form → 2-page preview → pay).

/packs/small-claims (checkout → pack).

/dashboard (user docs, follow-ups, statuses), /admin (orders, QA, content flags).

Blog, pricing, tools, legal pages, status, 404.

Event Taxonomy (emit to Supabase events)

ask.submitted {question,jurisdiction,user}

letter.created {slug,jurisdiction,user,paid:boolean}

letter.followup.scheduled {letterId,sendAt}

pack.purchased {caseId,jurisdiction,issue}

contract.purchased {slug,jurisdiction}

rewrite.purchased {sourceType}

translation.purchased {sourceType}

esign.added {docType,docId}

Data Contracts (Zod in packages/types)

Jurisdiction = 'uk-ew' | 'uk-sc' | 'uk-ni'

UserProfile { name:string; email:string; region:Jurisdiction }

ContractInput { slug:string; jurisdiction:Jurisdiction; answers:Record<string,any>; user:UserProfile }

ClaimsPackInput { issue:'invoice'|'deposit'|'repairs'|...; jurisdiction:Jurisdiction; facts:...; user:UserProfile }

Engineering: types first; server actions; ISR; webhooks; QA harness.
